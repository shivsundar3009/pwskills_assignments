The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design and states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility. When applied to Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), the principle can be adapted to database design and operations. Hereâ€™s how SRP can be integrated into RDBMS design:

1. **Table Design:**
   - Each table should represent a single entity or concept. For example, a `Customer` table should only store customer-related data, and an `Order` table should only store order-related data. This minimizes redundancy and ensures that each table has a single responsibility.

2. **Normalization:**
   - Normalize tables to reduce redundancy and dependency. Following normalization rules (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.) aligns with SRP by ensuring each piece of data is stored in one place and one place only, reducing the chance of anomalies and maintaining data integrity.

3. **Stored Procedures and Functions:**
   - Stored procedures and functions should perform one task or operation. For example, a procedure to calculate a discount should not also be responsible for updating inventory levels. This ensures that each procedure has a single responsibility.

4. **Views:**
   - Views should be created to represent specific subsets of data for particular purposes, rather than combining multiple responsibilities into a single view. This makes maintenance and understanding of the views easier.

5. **Triggers:**
   - Triggers should be used sparingly and should perform only the necessary actions for their specific event (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Complex business logic should not be embedded in triggers as it can lead to maintenance difficulties.

6. **Indexes:**
   - Indexes should be created to serve specific queries or operations. Over-indexing can lead to maintenance challenges and performance issues.

### Example

Consider an example of an e-commerce database:

- **Customer Table** (single responsibility: store customer details)
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Customer (
      CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Name VARCHAR(100),
      Email VARCHAR(100),
      Address VARCHAR(255)
  );
  ```

- **Order Table** (single responsibility: store order details)
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Order (
      OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      CustomerID INT,
      OrderDate DATE,
      TotalAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
      FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID)
  );
  ```

- **Product Table** (single responsibility: store product details)
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Product (
      ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Name VARCHAR(100),
      Description TEXT,
      Price DECIMAL(10, 2)
  );
  ```

- **OrderItem Table** (single responsibility: store order item details)
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE OrderItem (
      OrderItemID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      OrderID INT,
      ProductID INT,
      Quantity INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES Order(OrderID),
      FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Product(ProductID)
  );
  ```

In this design:
- The `Customer` table focuses solely on customer information.
- The `Order` table focuses solely on order information.
- The `Product` table focuses solely on product information.
- The `OrderItem` table focuses solely on the details of items within an order.

By adhering to SRP in RDBMS design, we ensure that each database object has a clear and distinct responsibility, which improves the maintainability, scalability, and clarity of the database schema.
