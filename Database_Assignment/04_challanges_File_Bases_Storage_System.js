File-based storage systems face several challenges that have been effectively addressed by Database Management Systems (DBMS). Here are five such challenges:

1. **Data Redundancy and Inconsistency**:
   - **File-based System**: Data redundancy occurs because the same data might be stored in multiple files. This redundancy leads to data inconsistency when updates are made in one place but not in others.
   - **DBMS**: By using normalization and relational models, DBMS reduces redundancy and maintains consistency through controlled data duplication and enforcing integrity constraints.

2. **Difficulty in Data Access**:
   - **File-based System**: Retrieving data from a file-based system requires custom scripts or applications for each query, which is time-consuming and complex.
   - **DBMS**: Provides powerful query languages like SQL (Structured Query Language) to easily and efficiently retrieve and manipulate data, improving accessibility and user interaction.

3. **Data Isolation**:
   - **File-based System**: Data is often isolated in separate files, making it difficult to coordinate and combine data from different sources.
   - **DBMS**: Integrates data into a single database, where relationships can be defined, and data can be easily shared and accessed across different applications.

4. **Atomicity Issues**:
   - **File-based System**: Ensuring that all parts of a transaction are completed successfully is difficult. If a system fails during a transaction, it can leave the data in an inconsistent state.
   - **DBMS**: Provides transaction management through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring that transactions are processed reliably and data integrity is maintained.

5. **Concurrent Access Anomalies**:
   - **File-based System**: Handling concurrent access by multiple users can lead to problems such as lost updates or dirty reads, where changes made by one user might not be visible to others or might overwrite changes.
   - **DBMS**: Manages concurrent access through locking mechanisms, isolation levels, and other concurrency control techniques to ensure data consistency and integrity during simultaneous access by multiple users.
